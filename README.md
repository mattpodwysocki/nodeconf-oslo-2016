# NodeConf Oslo 2016 - The Cathedral and the Bizarre World of NPM

## Abstract

The UNIX philosophy of small, single purpose modules has taken hold in the Node Community into an almost cult-like status. Hence NPM over the past year has skyrocketed in module count, easily overtaking Maven and others with many modules. With this comes many problems. After all, the UNIX philosophy may be small and single purpose modules, but they were especially curated over time for us, and we don't have to choose which grep, awk, or cat tool we wish to use. The problem with the small philosophy is now you have to literally jump through thousands of modules to find one that is well maintained and works well with others. Instead, we'll look at the much maligned frameworks which provide well tested and proven capabilities and see how we can reconcile these differences.
